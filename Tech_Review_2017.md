### ASCII and UNICODE 
ASCII defines 128 characters,mapping to 0-127 characters. Unicode defines 2<sup>21</sup> characters.
Unicode is a superset of ASCII, and the numbers 0â€“128 have the same meaning in ASCII as they have in Unicode.

Because Unicode characters don't generally fit into one 8-bit byte, there are numerous ways of storing Unicode characters in byte sequences, such as UTF-32 and UTF-8.
